# Breast Cancer Survival and Relapse Analysis, Prediction, and Risk Score System
## Overview
In this project, we analyzed the clinical data of 1,980 breast cancer patients. First of all, we conducted data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. After that, we drew overall survival and relapse curves using Kaplan-Meier. Then, we employed random survival forests for survival and relapse prediction. Next, the top-ranking variables were selected and integrated into a Cox regression model, thereby constructing a risk score system for better predicting the overall survival and relapse of breast cancer patients in clinical practice.
## Data
Our data is from the METABRIC project, funded by Cancer Research UK, the British Columbia Cancer Foundation and Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation BC/Yukon. Over 2,000 clinically annotated primary fresh-frozen breast cancer specimens were collected between 1977 â€“ 2005 from five centers in the UK and Canada.
## Files
The .csv file contains the data we used. The two .ipynb files are our code for analysis, one for EDA, Kaplan-Meier, and Random Survival Forest, and another for Cox Model and Risk Score Construction. The .pptx file shows the key sections and outcomes of this project.
